# Denver AirBnB Market Analysis in Tableau
Using AirBnB data from Denver, Colorado, I performed a curosry market analysis to understand the basics of the rental market. Inspired by friends in Salt Lake City who have successfully ventured into the AirBnB market along with a video from "Alex the Analyst" on YouTube, I downloaded data from AirBnB here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ and created a Tabelau visualization to summarize basic market findings and to suport further exploration.

Looking for financial opportunities is a great habit in a growing city like Salt Lake. Having renters build equity in a property for you in addition to possibly generating positive cash flow is enticing. This analysis was done to narrow donw general search results when looking for the most commonly used AirBnB properties. While there are many differences between Denver and Salt Lake City, similar general assumptions could be made that warrant furtner analysis or web scraping projects. A similar analysis could also be completed for cities that are similar to Salt Lake City to see if general trends hold true.

## Summary
Excel was used to download and transfer the data to Tableau. Data was then cleaned and validated using both built in Excel features, temporary COUNT functions, find and replace, and IF functions.
